# Cloud services
{: #cloud_services}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service to monitor user-initiated activities that change the state of any of the following services in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}


## Platform core integrated services
{: #platform_core_integrated}

Core platform services generate events that you can view through the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web UI. To view these events, you must [provision an instance](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-provision#provision) of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region.
{: note}

The following table lists core platform actions that send events to {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} by the **Resource controller service**:
