7. Select the `Lite` service plan. 

    By default, the lite plan is set.

8. Click **Create**.

After you provision an instance, the *Activity Tracker* dashboard opens. 


## Step 2. Manage access to the service
{: #gs_step2}

**Every user that accesses the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM user role defined.** The policy determines what actions the user can perform within the context of the service or instance you select. The allowable actions are customized and defined as operations that are allowed to be performed on the service. The actions are then mapped to IAM user roles. [Learn more](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-iam).

In this tutorial, you will learn how to grant a user management permissions to work with the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service within the context of a resource group.

After you set up your group, you must assign a common access policy to the group. Any policy that you set for an access group applies to all entities, users and service IDs, within the group.

When you define the policy, you need to select a platform role and a service role:
* Platform management roles cover a range of actions, including the ability to create and delete instances, manage aliases, bindings, and credentials, and manage access. The platform roles are administrator, editor, operator, viewer. Platform management roles also apply to account management services that enable users to invite users, manage service IDs, access policies, catalog entries, and track billing and usage depending on their assigned role on an account management service.
* Service access roles define a user or serviceâ€™s ability to perform actions on a service instance. The service access roles are manager, writer, and reader.

To manage the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service, a user needs the following roles:
* Platform role: **Administrator**. 
* Service role: **Manager**. 


Complete the following steps to assign a policy through the UI:

## Step 5. Viewing events
{: #gs_step5}


The {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service captures activity data that is related to API calls and other actions that are made to selected cloud services in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 

* Events are collected automatically. 
* Events that are collected in {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} comply with the **Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard**. The CADF standard defines a full event model that includes the information that is needed to certify, manage, and audit security of applications in cloud environments.
* {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} stores and groups events by location. 
* Events that report on global {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account actions, are collected and stored in **Frankfurt (EU-DE)**.
* The service plan that you select for your {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} instance sets the number of days that events are available for search through the web UI. 

When the web UI opens, the **Everything** view is displayed. You can see events through this view.

You can also define custom views to view a set of events by applying a timestamp, a search query, or both. [Learn more](/docs/services/Activity-Tracker-with-LogDNA?topic=logdnaat-views).


## Step 6. Learn about the structure of an event
{: #gs_step6}

Events comply with the **Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard**. The CADF standard defines a full event model that includes the information that is needed to certify, manage, and audit security of applications in cloud environments.

The CADF event model includes the following components:

| Component | Description |
|------------|----------------------------|
| `Action`   | The action is the operation or activity that an initiator performs, attempts to perform, or is waiting to complete. |
| `Initiator`| The initiator is the resource that makes an API call and generates a CADF event. The event that is triggered depends on the action that is requested by the API call. |
| `Observer` | The observer is the resource that creates and stores a CADF record from information available in a CADF event. |
| `Outcome`  | The outcome is the status of the action against the target. |
| `Target`   | The target is the resource against which the action is performed, attempted to perform, or is pending to complete. |
